Should have:

    ☐ High Score on NEAR -> host on IPFS

Could Have:
    ☐ Have ships shoot rockets ~ instakill or loose a mirror
    ☐ Playable on Desktop    
    ☐ Bonusses:
        ☐ Better shield
        ☐ Add damage to reflected laser 
        ☐ Increase Health

GAME:
    ☐ Basic: Enemies shoot lasers at you, you need to bounce them back
        ~ need lots of sounds
        ~ need lots of particles
    ☐ Intermidiate: Catching a laser between the two mirrors to get a bonus boost 
    ☐ Advanced: Integrate web monetization and decentralization
        challenges: 1) communicate between desktop and headset
                       possibly in a similar way as hmd.link does.
                    2) Getting enough _stuff_ up and running like 
                       artwork and variation to buy and use.
                       Maybe something like a mirror ball or different shields.
                       Maybe buying an NFT avatar you can use inside and outside 
                       of the game
        ☐ upgrade mirrors to add effects to the lasers, i.e. make them stronger, or split

IDEAS:
    ☐ Mirrors 
        - reflections 
        - different world behind the mirror
            - like the upside-down from stranger things
        - step through the mirror
        - bounce lasers
            - puzzel game

            - @high hold a mirror to bounce lasers shooting at you
                - player can't shoot
                - player only has 2 mirrors in their hands to bounce mirrors
                - player can use mirrors around the area to bounce lasers 
                - player can capture a laser between the to mirrors to boost (Casimir)
                - player can user upgrades (i.e. discoball to scatter laser)

        - horror type, stand in front of a mirror say a name (Candyman, Bloody Mary)
            ~ Spectrophobia
        - Casimir Effect - something about waves moving between mirrors in a vacuum
           ~ https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-casimir-effec/
        - dancing in front of a mirror

    ☐ Mirroring
        - repeat what the other does


    Bonus points:
        Web monetizations:
            - when monitized get access to more stuff
        Decentralized:
            ☐ @low list of highscores (NEAR)
            ☐ @low NFT on NEAR with Avatars. 
                ~ Maybe with special stats
                ~ Show the avatar on screen and with the highscore
                ~ Challenge, make A LOT of avatars
            - create puzzles and share them
            - @low Buy special NFT shields (NEAR)

            - Tournaments
