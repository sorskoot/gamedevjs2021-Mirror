    ✔ Add mirrors (boxes) we can hold in our hands @done(21-04-15 21:25)
    ✔ Enemies @done(21-04-15 21:52)
    ✔ Shooting enemies @done(21-04-15 22:52)
    ☐ Bounce back the bullets

GAME:
    ☐ Basic: Enemies shoot lasers at you, you need to bounce them back
        ~ need lots of sounds
        ~ need lots of particles
    ☐ Intermidiate: Catching a laser between the two mirrors to get a bonus boost 
    ☐ Advanced: Integrate web monetization and decentralization
        challenges: 1) communicate between desktop and headset
                       possibly in a similar way as hmd.link does.
                    2) Getting enough _stuff_ up and running like 
                       artwork and variation to buy and use.
                       Maybe something like a mirror ball or different shields.
                       Maybe buying an NFT avatar you can use inside and outside 
                       of the game

IDEAS:
    ☐ Mirrors 
        - reflections 
        - different world behind the mirror
            - like the upside-down from stranger things
        - step through the mirror
        - bounce lasers

            - @high hold a mirror to bounce lasers shooting at you
                - player can't shoot
                - player only has 2 mirrors in their hands to bounce mirrors
                - player can use mirrors around the area to bounce lasers 
                - player can capture a laser between the to mirrors to boost (Casimir)
                - player can user upgrades (i.e. discoball to scatter laser)
